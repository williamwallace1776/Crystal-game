# Crystal-game
This is a game where the user must achieve a target score by choosing values attributed to crystals without going over. 
The values of the crystal are hidden from the player, meaning the player must guess what the value of each crystal is.
After the player loses or wins, a counter is shown displaying wins and losses.
When a game is completed the values of the crystals and target score change.
